<p><br>Women are seen as destruction and pain. Effia is seen as a curse. When Effia is born on the night of a powerful fire that destroys much of her family’s livehood. It leads her father to believe that his family had just been cursed for generations. Effia’s father Cobbe Otcher leaves Effia with his wife, Baaba, to survey his yams, which have been damaged. He is hunted by the sight of the fire, Cobbe tells Baaba never to speak of what happened that day.<br><hr>

<br>Expected to follow everything they are told even if its against their will. As Effia matures and becomes increasingly beautiful, her mother, Baaba, continually beats and abuses her. When she is mature enough to start menstruating Baaba tells her to keep the fact between the two of them. Effia agrees, even though she knows that her chances of becoming a bride to the handsome new tribal chief, Abeeku, who has been interested in her ever since she was a child, would increase if he knew she had matured. Her chances of becoming his wife are ended when she finds herself accidentally present at a meeting between Abeeku and the white governor of the region, James Collins. We also see Cobbe commanding Baaba to love Effia after Cobbe dreams of living Effia in the dark forest.<br><hr>

<br>Abiding by the rules. Esi is kept in the dungeons below the castle with so many other women that they can barely move, covered in their own waste and starving.<br><hr>

<br>Mistreatment. When Cobbe comes home and discovers what happened, he and Baaba fight into the night, and he beats her for the cruel way she treated Effia. This begins a cycle, Baaba beats Effia, Cobbe beats Baaba. This cycle of beating also demonstrates how women experience violence at the hands of men and women.
Being loved. Esi was the beautiful daughter of an important man in her village, a wise and powerful warrior. She was treated with love and tenderness of her mother Maame and with pride by her father, and eventually learned that her mother was chosen by her father to be his wife in spite of her having had a troubled history, about which no-one will tell her. Eventually, and upon her father’s insistence, Esi’s mother took a young female prisoner into the family home.<br><hr>

<br>Fear. When Effia meets the soldier, she hides behind Cobbe’s leg, as she has never seen a white man before. Cobbe and Baaba show him their compound, explaining that each wife has her own hut that she shares with her children. The man’s eyes grow wide, finally understanding that the huts are where they live.<br><hr>

<br>Male-centric. The family structure is extremely male-centric. The men have more freedom in their marriages by being able to move wherever they want within the compound and marry several women, while the women are limited to a single hut and a single man. When Effia choose Abeeku to marry, other young people in the village recognizes the importance of marrying for power or status.<br><hr>

<br>Women are meant to be seen and not heard. When the dinner begins, Effia asks if Abeeku will work for the British. Her parents glare at her for speaking out of turn, but Abeeku smiles at her. He tells her he will work with the British, facilitating trade between the British and the Asantes. Effia nods and stays quiet, which she notes pleases Baaba. She has come to realize that Baaba prefers to remain silent and wants Effia to do the same.<br><hr>
